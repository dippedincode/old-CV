I am a full-stack software developer with over 15 years of product experience in various roles within multinational companies. Following a career change into programming I now have a passion craft new products in code, immerse myself in new technologies and continue to learn and grow as I do so. I am a graduate of Makers Academy where I have acquired the coding skills and techniques to help me on my way to becoming a world-class web programmer.

I seek a role in which I can continue to create and deliver innovative and robust products in an Agile framework, manage product backlogs and collaborate with stakeholders in both commercial and technology teams.

## Background
I have extensive commercial experience in web products. My last job was at an online gambling operator called Kindred. During my 6.5 years there the company grew in size from 300 to 1200 employees and more than doubled the number of customers and brands that it served. Its main brand is Unibet and I worked mainly on front-end deliverables for new products and landing pages for marketing teams.
